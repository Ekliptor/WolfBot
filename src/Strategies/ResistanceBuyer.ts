// TODO look at low/high values of candles to see if there is actual resistance at a certain price (not just on the order book)
// then we can buy a lot of coins at that level and wait for the price to move the other way
// obviously bad if the resistance breaks -> send a stronger buy/sell signal in the other direction then

// TODO 2nd idea: look at trades and check if the price can't get past a certain point (+/- a few %)
